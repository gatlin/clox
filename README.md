Gatlin's implementation of `clox` from [Crafting Interpreters][ciwebsite].
===

The book [*Crafting Interpreters*][ciwebsite] by Robert Nystrom walks the
reader through the design and implementation of two programming languages.
The second, `clox`, is compiled to a bytecode and then executed by a stack
machine in a single pass.

I have implemented everything up to and including chapter 26.
Chapters 27, 28, 29, and 30 are TODO.

I did not start keeping this project in version control until after I finished
chapter 26 so this history is not very interesting.
I hold some rather idiosyncratic C style conventions which I hope make the code
straightforward to read and understand.

The examples are not very interesting; they are whatever I had in the directory
when I decided to put it in version control.
Subject to change.
